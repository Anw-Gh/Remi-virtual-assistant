# Remi-virtual-assistant
Remi Virtual Assistant is my graduate project, utilizing the LLaMA-3 model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for smarter responses. It features text-to-speech via ElevenLabs and includes a 3D character in Unity. Users can interact with Remi using speech recognition in Unity or chat with her via text through a Telegram chatbot.
